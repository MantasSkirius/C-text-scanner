The Chomsky hierarchy in the fields of formal language theory, computer science, and linguistics, is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars. A formal grammar describes how to form strings from a formal language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. The linguist Noam Chomsky theorized that four different classes of formal grammars existed that could generate increasingly complex languages. Each class can also completely generate the language of all inferior classes (set inclusive).
History

The general idea of a hierarchy of grammars was first described by Noam Chomsky in "Three models for the description of language" during the formalization of transformational-generative grammar (TGG).[1] Marcel-Paul Sch√ºtzenberger also played a role in the development of the theory of formal languages; the paper "The algebraic theory of context free languages" describes the modern hierarchy, including context-free grammars.[3]

Independently, alongside linguists, mathematicians were developing models of computation (via automata). Parsing a sentence in a language is similar to computation, and the grammars described by Chomsky proved to both resemble and be equivalent in computational power to various machine models.
